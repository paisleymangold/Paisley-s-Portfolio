            <h1>Digit 100 Essays</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my collection of essays and reflections from DIGIT 100. Each piece explores aspects of digital culture, creativity, and technology.</p>

                <p>Developing websites through both GitHub Pages and the Penn State Web Page platform taught me a lot about how different tools shape the process of design and organization. Each page definitely had its own challenges, and both required a lot of patience and problem solving, but in very different ways.</p>
                
                <p>Working in GitHub Pages was the most difficult for me at first. Understanding the code language was challenging because one simple mistake that seemed small at the time could cause major problems. Even something like a missing character could stop the page from working altogether, which was both frustrating and tedious. It taught me how precise web development really is and gave me a better appreciation for the time that goes into it. It also took time to learn where my files were stored and how to keep everything organized. I had to figure out a system to track changes and double-check my edits before publishing. Once I started to get the hang of it, I realized how much creative freedom GitHub offers in comparison, but it takes a lot of careful attention to detail and a willingness to resolve issues when things go wrong.</p>
                
                <p>The Penn State Web Page platform was easier to learn and much simpler to use. It doesn’t give as much control over design, but it’s what I would call very beginner-friendly. Fixing mistakes is fast, and I didn’t have to worry about breaking the entire site over one small error. The biggest challenge and disappointment was working with layout limitations. It was hard to get my images to line up the way I wanted, so instead of smashing my computer, I ended up using Canva to arrange my gallery. The only problem with that method is that updating my gallery means editing it on Canva again and re-uploading it. Even though it wasn’t the most efficient solution, it gave me a sense of control over how my site looked, and I liked seeing my design ideas come together visually.</p>
                
                <p>When it came to modifying layouts, GitHub Pages was much more tedious and frustrating. I spent a lot of time resizing elements and fixing images that overlapped each other. There were moments where I had to completely start over just to make everything line up correctly. On the Penn State site, I had less control, but at least I didn’t have to fight with code to make basic changes. I actually prefer the overall design freedom of GitHub, where it looks cleaner and more professional, but for the sake of my own mental health, I have to admit that the Penn State Web Page is the one I enjoy using more. It’s easier and doesn’t leave me staring at a screen trying to fix something that broke for a reason I cannot figure out for the life of me. That balance between creativity and peace of mind really stood out to me.</p>
                
                <p>Both platforms helped me build important skills. I had to get better at navigating my computer, understanding file structure, and keeping everything organized. I also learned the importance of following certain rules in coding and web editing to avoid simple but frustrating mistakes. These experiences made me more confident about tackling digital projects on my own. Going forward, I’d like to learn more advanced design techniques to make my pages more visually appealing, whether that means shaping images, experimenting with colors, or improving the overall layout.</p>
                
                <p>After working with both sites, it became clear that GitHub Pages offers creativity and control, but at the cost of complexity. The Penn State Web Page is limited, but easy to use and forgiving for beginners. Each method taught me something different about how patience and problem-solving all connect in web development. In the end, the process showed me that creating a good website isn’t just about the tools, but it’s about learning how to adapt and fix problems.</p>
